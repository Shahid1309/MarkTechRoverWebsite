## 3. Keyword Cannibalization Risks ⚠️

**Status:** MINOR RISKS DETECTED (Expected for Service-Based Site)

**Findings:**

  - "hire" appears on multiple service pages (expected for commercial intent)
  - "agency" appears frequently (expected for service-based business)

**Analysis:**
- The overlaps are with common service-related words, not exact keyword matches
